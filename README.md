# Comparative Study on Performance of CNN Variants  
## An Approach Towards Emotion Recognition from Coloring Tasks

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comparative study of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for **emotion recognition based on coloring task images**. The objective is to analyze how various CNN variants perform in terms of accuracy, loss, and generalization when applied to visual emotion-related data.

Coloring tasks are increasingly explored in psychological and affective computing studies, making this work relevant for both **computer vision** and **emotion analysis** domains.
